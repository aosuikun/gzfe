Very experimental.

GZDoom launcher for iwads. Made to run on steamdeck. Uses gzdoom installed from flatpak flathub. 

TODO
- [ ] Make gzfe.py more general by removing hard-coded path for the iwads folder. Should instead ask user and let user edit. Also remember last path used to keep it there.
- [ ] Make gzfe.sh more robust. Currently using whatever is python to launch the app
