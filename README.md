Very experimental.

GZDoom launcher for mods/pwads. Made to run on steamdeck. Uses gzdoom installed from flatpak flathub. 

TODO
- [ ] Make gzfe.py more general by removing hard-coded path for the iwads folder. Should instead ask user and let user edit. Should also use last path selected as default.
- [ ] Make gzfe.sh more robust. Currently using whatever is "python" on the system to run the app
